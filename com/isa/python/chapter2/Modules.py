## Modules
# They are like packages in Java. In java packages can be in the same project your code redises or in another project packed as jar.
# I think Python modules are same in that way. Though specifying module name is a bit vague yet.
import sys
sys.stdout.write("Hello World!\n")
print sys.api_version
print sys.platform
print sys.version
