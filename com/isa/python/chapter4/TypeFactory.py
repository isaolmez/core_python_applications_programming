## Since in Python there is no special keyword for object creation, constructors are like regular methods.
##    int(), long(), float(), complex()   str(), unicode(), basestring()    list(), tuple()   type()
#  Also  dict()    bool()     set(), frozenset()     object()     classmethod()     staticmethod()     super()     property()     file()
# All of this are constructors and hence classes on their own. They are not builtin functions define on a module. Remember that functions need not to be bound to a class like in Java.
